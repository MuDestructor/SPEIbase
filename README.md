# SPEIbase

R code used in generating the SPEI global database, http://spei.csic.es/database.html.

In order to run the script (analysis.R), you need to replace the fake files in the 'inputData' directory with the real ones containing the data. These can be downloaded from the website of the Climatic Research Unit (CRU), University of East Anglia.
